This is a unity project, made by 6 people for a university project. The game is a platformer, where the goal is to score the highest score by jumping from platform to platform.
The character is always moving, so it makes it harder for a player to go higher.
Player loses the game when gets shot or touches an enemy (if you jump on top of an enemy you are fine).
The game has sound effects, ads system, various animations. We worked on the project for about 3-4 months, so the game is not close to finished.
This is the report about the game: [Knygnesys_Report.docx](https://github.com/JokubasZaveckis/Knygnesys/files/14431797/Knygnesys_Report.docx)
